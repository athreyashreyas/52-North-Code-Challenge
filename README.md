# 52-North-Code-Challenge
Repository for the code challenge given by 52Â°North as part of a GSoC 2023. The project aims to build an API wrapper for python clients wishing to use the OGC Processes API. Since a lot of OGC APIs have similar classes, paths and methods, an API wrapper would be able to abstract away specific request paths and make an efficient design for similar functions and API calls.
